    <h1>About us</h1>
    <hr class="bg-dark"/>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In our vision of the world, you will not find shades of gray and the stereotypical life beyond the grave.   We see a colourful world full of opportunities, tastes and experiences. It is precisely such a world we want to take you to. A world where everything stands on high-quality, tested foundations with a bit of that "spice" which separates a good dinner from a first class experience.   In order to do so, we make use of properly matured wines, which are now in their best condition.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><br>We took the liberty to prepare a bit of beauty for you in the interior of the restaurant, where you can find wonderful elements of leading Italian producers such as Brokis by Antonio De Luca,, Laura or Stefano. </p><p style="text-align: center;"><br>It is not enough to read it, is it? We understand. Come see for yourself. We shall look forward to seeing you.<br></p>

            <h2>Chef Petrov, deputy chief cook</h2>
            <p>He tried his first contact with cooking at a holiday chalet in the mountains that started the “ski slope” of other excellent career “ski-jumps” – e.g. under the baton of Jacques Auffrais, his French teacher, in the Circle Line restaurant or Carlo Bernardini, Petr Bureš, Nicolas Sale and Gilad Peled, chief cooks. He is not afraid of experiments. A perfect artistic creation that he is able to create on a plate is simply unmissable.</p>
